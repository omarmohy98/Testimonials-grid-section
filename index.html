                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the
                    company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                    “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition
                    and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
                    and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and
                    most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
                    working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                    “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
                    staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                    agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way
                    that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example
                    of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                    receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”

                    Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
